# Machine Learning from scratch with **R, Python and Matlab**

## Descriptions
I implement Random Forest, Softmax Resgession, Deep Neural Network, Convolutional Neural Network, Recurrent Neural Network to classify MNIST hand digit images from scratch. Most of methods are implemented in R. 

## Result
All methods achieved > 90% accuracy. The best result is **99%** by Convolutional Neural Network.
